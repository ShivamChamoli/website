            Wood sorrel offers an intimate, high quality preschool program for 
            2-5 year olds. Children during Preschool years learn more, and at a 
            greater speed than at any other time in their lives. The research 
            shows that half of childâ€™s adult intelligence is formed during the 
            first four years of his life and a child during these years has all 
            absorbent mind. He simply soaks up every experience. He learns by 
            sound, sight, taste smell and touch.

            This is the best time to focus on developing the overall personality 
            of a child. Wood sorrel is able to provide Ideal environment for the 
            all round development of a child by following Montessori inspired 
            child led/teacher facilitated/play based intensive preschool 
            curriculum. This system requires that the children are placed in a 
            well planned and structured environment in which child grows and 
            learns in a natural way. The children are free to follow their own 
            interests within this planned environment, rather than being forced 
            to learn something that is inappropriate to their development stage. 
            As a result children develop in a natural way and are highly 
            motivated. They develop good discipline and master basic skills. 
            Aspects of Reggio Emilia and other programs are sprinkled throughout 
            as well.
